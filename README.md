# Task Management Application - Backend

This is the backend for a Task Management Application built with Node.js and Express. The application provides user authentication and CRUD operations for managing tasks.

## Features
- User authentication using cookies
- CRUD operations for tasks
- Protected routes to ensure only authenticated users can access certain endpoints

## Technologies
- Node.js
- Express
- MongoDB (or preferred database)
- Mongoose (for MongoDB object modeling)
- Cookie-session (for handling cookies)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/task-management-backend.git
   cd task-management-backend
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following environment variables:
   ```plaintext
   PORT=5002
   MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   SESSION_SECRET=your_secret_key
   ```

## Usage

1. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. The server will be running at `http://localhost:5002`.

## API Endpoints

- **User Authentication**
  - `POST /api/login`: Logs in a user and sets a cookie.
  - `POST /api/logout`: Logs out a user and clears the cookie.
  
- **Tasks**
  - `GET /api/tasks`: Retrieves all tasks for the authenticated user.
  - `POST /api/tasks`: Creates a new task for the authenticated user.
  - `PUT /api/tasks/:id`: Updates an existing task.
  - `DELETE /api/tasks/:id`: Deletes a task.

## Middleware

The application includes middleware to verify user authentication for protected routes. This ensures that only logged-in users can access certain endpoints, such as task management.

## User Authentication

User authentication is handled via cookies. Upon successful login, a cookie is created to maintain the user's session.

## Database

Task data is stored in a MongoDB database, with tasks associated with authenticated users. Ensure that you have a MongoDB instance running and the connection string properly configured in the `.env` file.

### Notes:
- Replace `your-username` in the clone command with your actual GitHub username.
- Adjust the MongoDB connection string and other environment variables in the installation section as per your setup.
- You may want to add any specific commands or details relevant to your project in the README.
